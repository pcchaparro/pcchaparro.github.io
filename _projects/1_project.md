title: Evolutionary ecology of ecosystem resilience
description: Although environmental change triggers both ecological and evolutionary responses, the framework used to assess ecosystem resilience has lacked the evolutionary component thus far. To contribute towards the closure of this gap, I have developed the first generation of models that include evolutionary processes.

According to traditional ecological theory, when environmental conditions are favorable (i.e low environmental stress) the ecosystem is in the upper branch (State A in figure 1). If conditions gradually deteriorate, the ecosystem follows the stable equilibrium line until conditions exceed threshold 1. At this point (TP1), the upper stable equilibrium disappears, and thus a slight increment in the magnitude of environmental stress causes the ecosystem to tip to the lower branch (State B). Most efforts to prevent ecosystem regime shifts therefore focus on mantaining environmental stress below a safe magnitude, in this case, below threshold 1 (TP1). If this magnitude is exceeded, to restore the tipped ecosystem, it is not sufficient to reduce environmental stress below threshold 1, but to a much lower level of stress indicated by threshold 2 (TP2). Once the magnitude of environmental stress is below threshold 2, the ecosystem quickly recovers back to State A.

title: Eco-evolutionary responses to environmental change
description: The persistence of populations depends on the capacity of organisms to reproduce. But to reproduce, organisms must develop, grow, and survive from zygote to reproduction. I study how environmental stressors, by altering the performance of different developmental stages, affect population persistence and community stability.

The persistence of populations depends on the capacity of organisms to reproduce. But before organisms can reproduce, they must undergo one or various juvenile or immature stages during which they grow, sometimes substantially. Some fish species, for example, grow 4 to 5 orders of magnitude in size between hatching and the onset of reproduction. Hence, the capacity of populations and species to persist in the face of global change crucially depends on the capacity of organisms to develop, grow, and survive from zygote to reproduction, or in other words, to complete their life cycles. Therefore, studying how multiple environmental stressors, by altering the performance of different developmental stages, affect population dynamics is central to understanding species persistence and, ultimately, the maintenance of biodiversity.

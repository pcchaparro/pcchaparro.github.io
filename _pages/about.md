Welcome to my webpage! I am an evolutionary ecologist with a lifelong fascination with the natural world. My research aims to advance our understanding of the processes underlying the origin, resilience and adaptability of biodiversity to be able to predict how biodiversity will respond to future changes. To do so, my research integrates and synthesizes knowledge across multiple fields, drawing on, and contributing to, evolutionary biology, community ecology, ecosystem ecology, metabolic ecology, and ecological stoichiometry

I am a Marie Curie Fellow, an SNSF Ambizione fellow, and a recipient of the 2022 John Maynard Smith Prize in Evolutionary Biology. I am currently setting up my research group as Principal Investigator in the Department Systems Analysis, Integrated Assessment and Modelling at Eawag.

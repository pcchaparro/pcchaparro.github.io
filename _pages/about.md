Welcome to my webpage! I am an evolutionary ecologist with a lifelong fascination with the natural world. My research aims to advance our understanding of the processes underlying the origin, resilience and adaptability of biodiversity. To do so, I use a broad conceptual and empirical toolkit, working across various disciplines and combining theoretical and empirical approaches.

I am a Marie Curie Fellow and a recipient of the 2022 John Maynard Smith Prize in Evolutionary Biology. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the division of Theoretical Ecology and Evolution at the University of Bern.
